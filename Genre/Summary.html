                    <b>Author(s):</b> Alessandro L. Koerich
                    <b>Date:</b> 2013
                    <b>Pages:</b> 6
                    <b>Data Source:</b> Benchmark dataset ISMIR 2004, GTZAN [15], and LMD
                    <b>Algorithms used:</b>
                    Multi-class support vector machine (SVM) algorithm with one-against all strategy
                    A multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP) trained with the backpropagation momentum algorithm.

                    <b>Intro notes:</b>
                    - Fu et al [2] provide a comprehensive review on audio-based classification and systematically 
                    summarize the state-of-the-art techniques for music classification, stressing the difference 
                    in the features and the types of classifiers used for different classification tasks such as 
                    music genre classification, mood classification, artist identification, instrument recognition 
                    and music annotation.
                    <b>Body Notes:</b>
                    - The feature extraction module uses the MARSYAS framework to extract seventeen audio features from 
                    46ms frames of the audio signal with no overlap.
                    - The baseline classification determines the genre with certain possibilities
                    - The rejection system rejects classifications that are uncertain
                    - The verification system reclassifies some of the rejected classifications based on the output of the 
                    baseline classifier and confusion matrix
